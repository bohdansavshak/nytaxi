# API Documentation

## Swagger UI

This project includes Swagger UI for easy visualization and exploration of the API. Swagger UI allows you to interact with the API documentation in a user-friendly way.

To access Swagger UI, open your web browser and navigate to the following path:
[/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html](/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html)



This will launch Swagger UI, where you can explore the available API endpoints, view request and response examples, and test API calls directly from the documentation.

## OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is provided to offer a comprehensive view of the API's structure and functionality. The raw OpenAPI JSON can be accessed at:
[/v3/api-docs](/v3/api-docs)

You can use this OpenAPI Specification to generate client libraries, server stubs, and more. This can be particularly useful for automating the integration process.
